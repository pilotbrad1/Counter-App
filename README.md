Scrimba 

Dio can you hear me
I am lost and so alone
I'm asking for guidance
Won't you come down from your throne
I need a tight compadre 
who will teach me how to rock
my father thinks you're evil 
but man he can suck a cock
Rock is not the devil's work
It's magical and rad
I'll never rock as long as 
I am stuck here with my dad

I hear you brave young J-bls
You are hungry for the rock
But to learn the ancient lessons
secret doors you must unlock
To escape your father's clutches
and this oppressive neighbourhood
on a journey you must go 
to find the land of hollywood.
In the city of fallen angels
where the ocean meets the sand
you will form a strong alliance
and the world's most awesome band
To find your fame and fortune
through the valley you must walk
you must face your inner demons
now go my son and rock.
